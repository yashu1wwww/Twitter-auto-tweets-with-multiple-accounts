# Twitter-auto-tweets-with-multiple-accounts
Twitter auto tweets with multiple accounts using selenium with python

# Here, I have added up to 5 accounts which will auto-login and auto-tweet in twitter

# Change the random words if you want different words.

# Must change username and password field..

# change how much tweet needed ...

# Note: For auto-login, the accounts used must be non-authentication accounts

Download the latest version of chromedriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/. After downloading, extract the file and place it in the same folder as the "g.py" file.

Note: Do not use accounts with two-factor authentication.

To run the script, open the command prompt in the folder and enter "g.py" or double-click on the "g.py" file to start the automated process.

# 👉 Note: Every time Twitter updates the code, it varies. So press 'Ctrl+Shift+C' to open the developer tools, and inspect and fork it..


👉Note:-

👉if your selenium version is in latest version then the code never run

👉open cmd and enter pip uninstall selenium

And enter

pip install selenium==4.2.1 or pip install selenium==4.2.0

and hit enter

and

python -c "import selenium; print(selenium.version)"
