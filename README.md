# the Twitter post URL in the 31st line, and replace the '5' with how many tweets you want in the 50th line.

Download the latest version of chromedriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/. After downloading, extract the file and place it in the same folder as the "g.py" file.

Replace lines 18 and 22 with your Twitter username and password. Also, replace lines 63 and 67 with your Twitter username and password.

Note: Do not use accounts with two-factor authentication.

To run the script, open the command prompt in the folder and enter "g.py" or double-click on the "g.py" file to start the automated process.
