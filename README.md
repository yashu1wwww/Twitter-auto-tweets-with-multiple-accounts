# Twitter-auto-tweets-with-multiple-accounts
Twitter auto tweets with multiple accounts using selenium with python

Here, I have added code to auto-login and tweet using up to 2 Twitter accounts. If you want to add more accounts, you can copy lines 57 to 96 and paste them on line 97. You can use Note++ to find the line number. Repeat the process to add more accounts, and don't forget to replace "acc" with the actual password.

Download the latest version of chromedriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/. After downloading, extract the file and place it in the same folder as the "g.py" file.

Replace lines 18 and 22 with your Twitter username and password. Also, replace lines 63 and 67 with your Twitter username and password.

Note: Do not use accounts with two-factor authentication.

To run the script, open the command prompt in the folder and enter "g.py" or double-click on the "g.py" file to start the automated process.


👉Note:-

👉if your selenium version is in latest version then the code never run

👉open cmd and enter pip uninstall selenium

And enter

pip install selenium==4.2.1 or pip install selenium==4.2.0

and hit enter

and

python -c "import selenium; print(selenium.version)"
